          The network team wants to make sure that all the client VLANs have HTTP/S access to the data center.
          If this rule is violated, do not push, we will have an outage.

        comment: VLAN30 has our general non-engineering employees (sales, marketing, HR).
                 They will never need SSH access to servers so this should be denied.

      Finance wants to define their own policies. These can overlap, add, or even conflict
      as rules are run independently
